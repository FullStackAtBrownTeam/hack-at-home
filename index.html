            <p>
                Full Stack at Brown is a Brown University club dedicated to promoting software engineering. Our members
                complete pro-bono projects for other Brown University clubs and members of the Brown community.

            <h2>Socially distanced hacking</h2>
            <p>
                Hack@Home is virtual hackathon that focuses on bringing a diverse set of student hackers, designers, and
                thinkers together to "hack@home" and create projects that will solve different issues brought up by the
                coronavirus pandemic. Hackers can work on projects in groups or independently participate in CTF and
                dataset challenges to win sponsored prizes. Newcomers will have an opportunity to get a taste of Brown
                CS through workshops, the open Brown University Minecraft campus, and a diverse array of Brown
                University speakers and panelists. We will also be conducting a fundraising livestream during the event
                to raise money for different charities and organizations.

                GitHub Actions gives teams world-class CI capabilities, helping developers merge and deploy code many
                times in a single day. The silent power of GitHub Actions lies in its ability to programmatically define
                just about any workflow to mirror your team's processes. In this workshop, you'll learn how to:
